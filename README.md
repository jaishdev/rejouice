 # Rejouice Clone — UI Animation Practice

This is a frontend-focused UI clone of [Rejouice](https://www.rejouice.com/), built to practice high-level animation, layout design, and interactive experiences.

> ⚠️ This is a **personal practice project**. All design inspiration and layout structure credit goes to the original creators at Rejouice.

## Why I Built This

The original site pushed the boundaries of web animation and branding. I wanted to challenge myself to recreate its core visual feel — especially the smooth animations and transitions — using only frontend technologies.

## What I Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP (for animations)

## Live Site

## Notes

- This is not a 1:1 replica — it's a *learning project* focused on improving animation and frontend polish.  
- UI was replicated by inspecting and studying the original.  
- No backend or functionality — this is purely a visual/UX project.

## What I Learned

- Scroll and hover-based animation handling  
- Working with GSAP timelines and transitions  
- How small motion details can define brand experience
